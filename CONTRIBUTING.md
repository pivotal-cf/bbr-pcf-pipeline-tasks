# Contributing to BBR PCF Pipeline Tasks
This project welcomes contributions from the community.

If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our contributor license agreement (CLA), our bot will update the issue when you open a Pull Request.

For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ](https://cla.vmware.com/faq).

## Commit messages

Please follow [the rules of writing good Git commit
messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules):

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

In addition to those rules, we also like to include references to external
resources, such as Pivotal Tracker stories and GitHub issues. For example, at
the bottom of your commit messages:

```
[GH: Fixes #123, Related: #432, #111]
[finishes #3494307298](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/3494307298)
```

Also, if you're pairing or working with more people on your commit, we encourage
you to use the `Co-authored-by` line in order to attribute credit to everyone
that contributed. For example (yes you can have as many of those as you want):

```
Co-authored-by: Rob Boshman <rboshman@cloudfoundry.org>
Co-authored-by: Alice Boshington <aboshington@cloudfoundry.org>
```
